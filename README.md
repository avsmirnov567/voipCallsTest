# voipCallsTest
This repo contains my experiments with VoIP calls.

I used our serverside to establish SIP-connection between two clients: parent (can only call) and child (can only answer calls).
The most tricky for me was audio encoding/decoding. All my experiments with audio are in [this](https://github.com/avsmirnov567/aacEncodingTest) repository.
